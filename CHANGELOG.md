## [Milestone 1 Hardening] — 2026-06-25

### Changed

- `backend/phpstan.neon` — raised from level 6 to **level 8**; passes with 0 errors; no code changes required
- `docs/STATUS.md` — stack table added (PHP 8.3+, Laravel 13.x, PHPStan level 8); technical debt section expanded with three named items; next tasks reordered to put ULID `User` PK conversion first; PHPStan level 8 decision recorded; project health notes clarified to distinguish placeholder models from implemented persistence
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this entry

### Technical Debt Recorded

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Eloquent model stubs are placeholders only | No migrations, fillable, casts, or relationships — exist for PHPStan type resolution only |
| Queue tests use `Queue::fake()` | Dispatch mechanism is proven; live Redis worker execution is not tested yet |
| `User` model uses integer PK | Must be converted to `char(26)` ULID before `company_memberships` migration |

## [Milestone 1] — Platform Foundation — 2026-06-25

### Added

**Laravel Application (`backend/`)**
- Laravel 13.17 project created in `backend/`
- PHP 8.3, Composer 2.x
- `backend/.env` — configured for PostgreSQL + Redis (queue, cache, session drivers)
- `backend/.env.example` — documented template for new environments
- `backend/pint.json` — Laravel preset with `simplified_null_return`, `blank_line_before_statement`, `new_with_parentheses`
- `backend/phpstan.neon` — Larastan at level 8; paths: `app/`

**Queue Topology (`backend/config/queue.php`)**
- Five named queue connections: `high`, `ai`, `default` (Redis), `observations`, `maintenance`
- `ai` queue has elevated `retry_after` (300s) to accommodate long AI calls
- Batching and failed job tables point to PostgreSQL (not SQLite)

**Domain Folder Structure**
- `app/Domain/Company/`
- `app/Domain/Catalog/`
- `app/Domain/BusinessBrain/`
- `app/Domain/Opportunity/`
- `app/Domain/Decision/`
- `app/Domain/Recommendation/`
- `app/Domain/Campaign/`
- `app/Domain/Shared/`
- `app/Application/`
- `app/Infrastructure/`
- `app/Presentation/`

**Core AI Contracts and Abstractions**
- `app/AI/Contracts/AiProvider.php` — single `complete(Prompt): AiResponse` method; the only interface external code touches
- `app/AI/AiResponse.php` — readonly value object: `content`, `model`, `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`
- `app/AI/Prompts/Prompt.php` — abstract base: `system()`, `user()`, `schema()`, `temperature()`, `maxTokens()`, `version()`, `name()`
- `app/AI/Testing/FakeAiProvider.php` — test double: `queueResponse()`, `queueFixture()`, `complete()`, `assertPromptSent()`, `assertNothingSent()`, `sentCount()`
- `tests/Fixtures/AI/` — directory for JSON fixtures consumed by `FakeAiProvider::queueFixture()`

**Domain Service Contracts**
- `app/Services/Analyst/Contracts/Analyst.php` — marker interface; only Analysts may call `AiProvider`
- `app/Services/Observatory/Connectors/Contracts/Connector.php` — `supports(Integration): bool`, `sync(Integration): Observation`
- `app/Services/Opportunity/Detectors/Contracts/OpportunityDetector.php` — `appliesTo(): string[]`, `detect(BusinessBrain): Collection`
- `app/Services/Content/Contracts/ContentGenerator.php` — `channel(): string`, `generate(Campaign): ContentAsset`

**Domain Value Objects**
- `app/Domain/BusinessBrain/BusinessBrain.php` — readonly value object assembled by `BusinessBrainService::for(Company)`; never persisted

**Eloquent Model Stubs** (structure only; no migrations, fillable, or relationships yet)
- `app/Models/Company.php` — with `SoftDeletes`
- `app/Models/DigitalTwin.php`
- `app/Models/Catalog.php`
- `app/Models/Integration.php`
- `app/Models/Observation.php`
- `app/Models/Campaign.php` — with `SoftDeletes`
- `app/Models/ContentAsset.php` — with `SoftDeletes`

**Bootstrap Tests (25 tests, all passing)**
- `tests/Feature/ApplicationBootTest.php` — Laravel boots, container resolves core bindings, environment is `testing`
- `tests/Feature/DatabaseConnectionTest.php` — DB connection established, migrations table exists, users table exists
- `tests/Feature/QueueDispatchTest.php` — jobs dispatched to queues, all five Atlas queues configured
- `tests/Feature/RedisConnectionTest.php` — Redis ping + set/get (skipped when Redis not in test env)
- `tests/Unit/AI/FakeAiProviderTest.php` — queueResponse, ordering, empty-queue exception, assertPromptSent, assertNothingSent, chaining
- `tests/Unit/AI/PromptTest.php` — defaults, version override, name, system/user return strings

**Infrastructure**
- `infrastructure/supervisor/atlas-worker.conf` — Supervisor config for all five queue workers

**CI/CD**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions: PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7 services, Pint → PHPStan → PHPUnit on push/PR to `main`/`develop`

**Packages Installed**
- `laravel/sanctum` ^4.3 — API token authentication (used in Phase 2)
- `larastan/larastan` ^3.10 — PHPStan extension for Laravel

### Changed

- `app/Models/User.php` — untouched; uses default Laravel integer PK (will be migrated to ULID in Phase 2)
