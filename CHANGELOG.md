## [Milestone 2 Cleanup] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- `app/Services/Company/CompanyService.php` — default Catalog type corrected from `'inventory'` to `'mixed'`; `'mixed'` is the correct generic default for a newly onboarded company
- `tests/Feature/Discovery/CompanyServiceTest.php` — `test_creates_catalog_for_company` now explicitly asserts `type = 'mixed'`

### Added

- `app/Services/Observatory/IntegrationService.php` — `create(Company, string $type, array $config): Integration`; sets `name` via `defaultName()` match, `status: active`, `next_run_at: +7 days`; dispatches `SyncIntegration` immediately on creation
- `app/Jobs/SyncIntegration.php` — now implements `ShouldBeUnique`; `uniqueId()` returns `$this->integration->id` — prevents duplicate sync jobs from stacking in the queue
- `tests/Feature/Discovery/IntegrationServiceTest.php` — 5 new tests: correct attributes, encrypted config, `next_run_at` 7-day window, immediate `SyncIntegration` dispatch, default name for `website_crawl`
- `tests/Feature/Discovery/SyncPipelineTest.php` — `test_sync_integration_is_unique_per_integration` asserts job implements `ShouldBeUnique` and `uniqueId()` returns integration id

### Result

- 48 tests total; 46 passing, 2 skipped (Redis); PHPStan level 8 — 0 errors; Pint — clean

## [Milestone 2] — Discovery & Knowledge Platform — 2026-06-26

### Added

**Database Migrations (`backend/database/migrations/`)**
- `2026_06_26_000000_create_users_table.php` — rewrites Laravel default; `char(26)` ULID PK; sessions table `user_id` updated to `char(26)`
- `2026_06_26_000300_create_personal_access_tokens_table.php` — Sanctum migration; `char(26)` tokenable_id replacing default `bigInteger` morphs
- `2026_06_26_000400_create_companies_table.php` — `char(26)` PK, `slug` unique, `brand`/`settings` JSON, `softDeletes`
- `2026_06_26_000500_create_company_memberships_table.php` — `char(26)` PK/FKs, role enum (owner/admin/member/viewer)
- `2026_06_26_000600_create_catalogs_table.php` — `char(26)` PK, one per company, type enum (inventory/services/menu/listings/mixed)
- `2026_06_26_000700_create_digital_twins_table.php` — `char(26)` PK, status enum (initializing/active/stale/archived), health_score
- `2026_06_26_000800_create_integrations_table.php` — `char(26)` PK, type enum, encrypted config column, `last_successful_run_at`
- `2026_06_26_000900_create_observations_table.php` — `char(26)` PK, status enum (pending/processing/processed/failed), compound indexes

**Eloquent Models (`backend/app/Models/`)**
- `User.php` — `HasUlids`, `HasApiTokens`, `HasFactory<UserFactory>`; `memberships()` relationship
- `Company.php` — `HasUlids`, `SoftDeletes`, `HasFactory<CompanyFactory>`; auto-slugs from name; all relationships with generic type annotations
- `CompanyMembership.php` — `BelongsToCompany`, `HasUlids`; `user()`, `inviter()` relationships
- `Catalog.php` — `BelongsToCompany`, `HasUlids`; `item_schema` array cast
- `DigitalTwin.php` — `BelongsToCompany`, `HasUlids`; `isActive()`, `isInitializing()` helpers
- `Integration.php` — `BelongsToCompany`, `HasUlids`; `config` cast as `encrypted:array`; `markAsError()`; `last_successful_run_at`
- `Observation.php` — `BelongsToCompany`, `HasUlids`, `Prunable`; 180-day prune with payload nulling; `markProcessing/Processed/Failed()`

**Multi-Tenancy Foundation (`backend/app/Domain/Shared/`)**
- `Scopes/CompanyScope.php` — applies `WHERE company_id = ?` when `current_company_id` is bound in the container; no-op otherwise
- `Concerns/BelongsToCompany.php` — registers `CompanyScope`; provides `company()` `BelongsTo` relationship

**Connector Framework (`backend/app/Services/Observatory/Connectors/`)**
- `Contracts/Connector.php` — `supports(Integration)`, `sync(Integration): Collection<int, ConnectorResult>`
- `ConnectorResult.php` — readonly value object: `sourceType`, `sourceIdentifier`, `payload`, `observedAt`
- `ConnectorRegistry.php` — `resolve(Integration): Connector` (throws `UnsupportedIntegrationException`); `all(): array`
- `Exceptions/UnsupportedIntegrationException.php` — thrown when no connector supports an integration type
- `Website/WebPageData.php` — readonly value object for a single crawled page; `toArray()` serialises for payload
- `Website/WebPageCrawler.php` — BFS crawler; Guzzle HTTP + DOMDocument + DOMXPath; max 20 pages / depth 3; strips nav/footer/scripts; 5,000-char body text cap; single fetch per page (links extracted from same parse)
- `Website/WebsiteConnector.php` — implements `Connector`; crawls URL from `integration->config['url']`; maps `WebPageData → ConnectorResult`

**Observation Pipeline**
- `app/Services/Company/CompanyService.php` — `create(User, array): Company`; one DB transaction wraps Company + Catalog + DigitalTwin + owner CompanyMembership
- `app/Services/Observatory/ObservationService.php` — `record()` / `recordAll()`; persists `ConnectorResult` as `Observation`; dispatches `ObservationRecorded`
- `app/Events/ObservationRecorded.php` — fired after each Observation is persisted
- `app/Events/IntegrationSyncStarted.php` — fired when `SyncIntegration` begins
- `app/Events/IntegrationSyncCompleted.php` — fired when sync finishes; carries observation count
- `app/Jobs/SyncIntegration.php` — resolves connector via registry; syncs; records observations; updates timestamps; on `observations` queue; marks integration as error on failure
- `app/Jobs/ProcessObservation.php` — stub job on `ai` queue; no-op until Milestone 3 adds AI fact extraction
- `app/Listeners/DispatchObservationProcessing.php` — listens to `ObservationRecorded`; dispatches `ProcessObservation`

**Service Providers**
- `app/Providers/ConnectorServiceProvider.php` — registers `ConnectorRegistry` singleton with `WebsiteConnector`
- `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` — wires `ObservationRecorded → DispatchObservationProcessing`
- `bootstrap/providers.php` — registers `ConnectorServiceProvider`

**Factories**
- `database/factories/CompanyFactory.php` — generates realistic company data for tests

**Feature Tests (`backend/tests/Feature/Discovery/`)**
- `CompanyServiceTest.php` — 5 tests: company creation, catalog, digital twin status, owner membership, atomicity
- `TenantIsolationTest.php` — 2 tests: CompanyScope filters by bound company; no-op when no company bound
- `ConnectorRegistryTest.php` — 3 tests: resolves WebsiteConnector; throws for unsupported type; registry is non-empty
- `WebsiteConnectorTest.php` — 2 tests: maps crawled pages to ConnectorResults; `supports()` correctly typed
- `SyncPipelineTest.php` — 2 tests: `SyncIntegration` dispatches to `observations` queue; `ProcessObservation` dispatches to `ai` queue

### Changed

- `backend/app/Models/Observation.php` — import order fixed by Pint
- `backend/app/Domain/Shared/Scopes/CompanyScope.php` — `@implements Scope<Model>` annotation added; FQCN fix by Pint

### Spec Deviation

- `Connector::sync()` declared as `sync(): Collection<int, ConnectorResult>` instead of spec's `sync(): Observation` — one result per crawled page/feed item, not one aggregate per sync. `ObservationService` is responsible for persisting each `ConnectorResult` as its own `Observation`.

## [Milestone 1 Hardening] — 2026-06-25

### Changed

- `backend/phpstan.neon` — raised from level 6 to **level 8**; passes with 0 errors; no code changes required
- `docs/STATUS.md` — stack table added (PHP 8.3+, Laravel 13.x, PHPStan level 8); technical debt section expanded with three named items; next tasks reordered to put ULID `User` PK conversion first; PHPStan level 8 decision recorded; project health notes clarified to distinguish placeholder models from implemented persistence
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this entry

### Technical Debt Recorded

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Eloquent model stubs are placeholders only | No migrations, fillable, casts, or relationships — exist for PHPStan type resolution only |
| Queue tests use `Queue::fake()` | Dispatch mechanism is proven; live Redis worker execution is not tested yet |
| `User` model uses integer PK | Must be converted to `char(26)` ULID before `company_memberships` migration |

**Infrastructure**
- `infrastructure/supervisor/atlas-worker.conf` — Supervisor config for all five queue workers

**CI/CD**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions: PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7 services, Pint → PHPStan → PHPUnit on push/PR to `main`/`develop`

**Packages Installed**
- `laravel/sanctum` ^4.3 — API token authentication (used in Phase 2)
- `larastan/larastan` ^3.10 — PHPStan extension for Laravel
